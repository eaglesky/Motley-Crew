# Questmaster

Questmaster is a web application where the users can perform real-life "quests"
for other users in return for rewards. The quests are localized to geographic 
locations. A user can create quests for others to complete in return for rewards
which can be monetary or non-monetary. Similarly, a user can accept quests from 
other users and collect rewards. These collected rewards may be redeemed at any 
later point in time.

This project will be developed over the course of the Fall 2014 quarter at UCSB.
